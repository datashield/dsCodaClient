\title{Build sequential ILR basis matrix (sequential binary partition)}
\usage{
build_sequential_ilr_V(D, part_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{An integer giving the number of parts in the composition (>= 2).}

\item{part_names}{Optional character vector of part names to use as row names.}
}
\value{
A numeric `D x (D - 1)` matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis
  for ILR coordinates under the sequential SBP. Row names are taken from 
  `part_names` when provided; column names are `ilr1`, ..., `ilr(D-1)`.
}
\description{
Construct an orthonormal contrast matrix `V` for ILR coordinates using the
sequential binary partition (SBP): at step `j` compare part `j` against
the remaining parts `j+1..D`.
}
\details{
The resulting `V` can be supplied to `compositions::ilr(x, V = V)` to
  perform the isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformation based on a sequential
  binary partition. Column `j` contrasts part `j` with the remaining parts `j+1..D`,
  with appropriate normalizing constants to ensure orthonormality.
}
\examples{
# Using number of parts only
V3 <- build_sequential_ilr_V(3)

# Using number of parts with custom names
part_names <- c('vpa', 'mpa', 'lipa', 'sleep', 'sb')
V5 <- build_sequential_ilr_V(5, part_names)

# Use with compositions::ilr
# ilr_vals <- compositions::ilr(X, V = V5)
